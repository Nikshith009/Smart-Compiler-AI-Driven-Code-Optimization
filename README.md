🚀 How It Works

User uploads a leaf or crop image.

Image is preprocessed and passed into the CNN model.

Model predicts the pest category (e.g., aphids, beetles, fruit flies).

System returns:

Pest Name

Severity

Basic treatment suggestions

📊 Model Performance

High accuracy achieved using transfer learning

Better feature extraction from MobileNet, DenseNet & InceptionV3

Faster training and prediction time

🎯 Applications

Smart agriculture

Early pest detection

Crop disease management

Automated crop monitoring
